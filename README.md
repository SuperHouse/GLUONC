Innfos Gluon Controller
=======================

The Gluon is a robot arm reference design manufactured by Innfos, a
Chinese manufacturer of robot actuators.

The Gluon is supplied with an Ethernet-to-CAN-bus adaptor board so that
it can be controlled using a network socket connection.

This project aims to develop a suitable method for controlling a Gluon
using alternative user interfaces such as integrating with a wheelchair
control system.
